# CFPB Consumer Complaint Analysis (Work in Progress)

This project is currently in progress. It explores consumer complaint data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to analyze trends, sentiment, and potential indicators of broader financial stress.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Raw and cleaned data files
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data preparation, exploratory analysis, and modeling
- **.gitignore**: Ignores data folder and other unnecessary files


## Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the CFPB complaint dataset
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and summarize key trends and features
3. **Modeling**: Apply NLP and machine learning to analyze complaint narratives and predict sentiment or trends

## Status
This repository is a work in progress. Notebooks and code are being actively developed and updated.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, transformers, zipcodes

## Usage
1. Place raw data in the `data/` folder
2. Run notebooks in order: data preparation → exploratory analysis → modeling
3. Outputs and visualizations will be generated in the notebooks
