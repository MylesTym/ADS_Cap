         "On approximately XX/XX/19, I took advantage of an offer from my credit card company, Bank of America, for a 0 % interest cash advance promotion, with a 5 % fee the amount of the promotional cash advance. This promotion stated that I could use the promotional check to transfer a balance or deposit any amount up to my credit limit into my personal checking account. Nowhere did the offer state that making the check out to myself would result in foregoing the promotional offer. I wrote a check out for {$19000.00} to myself and the check was deposited on or around XX/XX/19, thinking that I had initiated a cash advance under the terms of the promotion. \n\nOn the most recent billing statement ending XX/XX/2019, I noticed a substantial interest charge of {$290.00}. I thought this was a mistake, so I called the customer service number for Bank of America and spoke to a representative. She informed me that, according to her three supervisors, because I had made the check out to myself, I was not taking advantage of the promotional offer. In fact, I was told that if I had made the check out to my wife, and deposited it into the very same account, that I would have received the promotional offer. Furthermore, I was told that if I had called them to initiate the cash advance over the phone, I would have received the promotional offer. I informed them that I had used some form of this promotional cash advance from Bank of America for over 10 years and never had this problem, even when writing the check out to myself, and that if I had known that writing the check to myself would result in not receiving the promotional offer, I would not have used the promotional check. I was told that the terms and conditions of my cardholder agreement makes writing a promotional check to myself outside of any promotional offer, despite the fact that the offer explicitly states that I could deposit the promotional cash advance into my personal checking account, and that I had no recourse. \n\nI am frustrated by this deceptive practice and the inherent unfairness of this promotional offer, which states that the check could be deposited into my personal checking account, yet if I make the check to myself, that it can not receive the promotional offer. Due to this deception, I have had fees of {$760.00}, and current interest of {$360.00} billed to me. I offered to pay off the original amount if they refunded this money, but they refused. \n\nPlease help end this deceptive practice, and help rectify this situation.",

The original amount of the debt to  XXXX  was {$1100.00} from  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX , and payments were made to  XXXX  through their website between  XXXX   XXXX  and  XXXX  of  XXXX  until the amount was paid off.     The collection agent I spoke with was extremely rude to me and refused to let me speak or even finish a sentence. When I told him that I was disputing the debt, and that the original amount of the debt was less than the collection notice, not to mention all the payments, he said that I would have to provide proof of payment to  XXXX , rather than him requesting same from the company.     I also told him that the collection notice had an incorrect name for me, and he said it did n't matter. Throughout the conversation, he bullied me, would n't let me speak, talked over me, was harassing and ruder than anyone I have ever dealt with over the phone and caused me to be extremely anxious and in emotional distress.     He refused to let me talk about the facts or numbers in question and kept saying that he would have to get a copy of the original agreement. Collection agencies should have proof that a debt is actually owed before they start harassing citizens. Also, when a consumer disputes a debt, there should be a professional response from the collection agency, not bullying, condescension, etc.",
